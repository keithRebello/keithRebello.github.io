                            <p style="text-align: left;">My dream is to make a world where everyone has someone.  <br>
                                Right now, the world is filled with people, both young and old, who don't have anyone.  Even people with support systems might sometimes feel like they can't share things affecting them right when they need to.  Artificial agents could offer that hand to people in need who might otherwise not have access to a human friend. <br></p>
                                
                            <p style="text-align: left;">    The goal isn't to replace humans; it's to help those who don't have immediate access to good support and are in need.</p>
                                
                            <p style="text-align: left;">    My research interests are creating empathic conversational agents capable of understanding humans the way humans do and conveying that understanding so they feel heard. Using my background in human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and mental health, I explore ways to make these agents real. </p>
                                
                            <p style="text-align: left;">    I am pursuing my master's in Artificial Intelligence from <em>Northeastern University</em> . For my master's thesis, I am building a hierarchical multimodal computational model of empathy for a Furhat robot. I want to study whether this implementation elicits feelings of being understood in humans who have conversations with it.</p>
                                
                            <p style="text-align: left;">    I also work part-time as a Research Assitant for the <em>Relational Agents Group Lab</em>, where I talk to robots and great people. </p>

                                                    <p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.</p>

                                                    <p>Graphs have proved to be a promising data structure to solve complex problems in various domains. Graphs store data in an associative manner which is analogous to the manner in which humans store memories in the brain. Generathe chatbots lack the ability to recall details revealed by the user in long conversations. To solve this problem, we have used graph-based memory to recall-related conversations from the past. Thus, providing context feature derived from query systems to generative systems such as OpenAI GPT. Using graphs to detect important details from the past reduces the total amount of processing done by the neural network. As there is no need to keep on passingthe entire history of the conversation. Instead, we pass only the last few pairs of utterances and the related details from the graph. This paper deploys this system and also demonstrates the ability to deploy such systems in real-world applications. Through the effective usage of knowledge graphs, the system is able to reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) as compared to similar non-graph based implementations of transfer learning- based conversational agents.</p>

                                                    <p>The application of effective techniques like facial recognition and object detection in the domain of IoT has revolutionized the levels of control and accuracy sensors have had for a variety of purposes. Face recognition modules have established their immense usefulness, and their impact has overweighed most other traditional forms of access control. It remains one of the most secure methods to authenticate human beings to grant them access to restricted areas or systems in an organization. However, this incomparable rise in accuracy comes with a relatively huge price. The algorithms used in facial recognition are complex mathematical functions that are iteratively performed on vast volumes of data continuously. In IoT applications, the embedded systems that run these algorithms are at all times clocked to their maximum processing power, they need not run in cases when there are no humans are present in the vicinity. This is inefficient, especially in systems that need to perform face recognition round-the-clock for authentication. This paper proposes a simple, intuitive and efficient solution to conserve the processor from being clocked to its maximum throughput without compromising on the high level of security that the face recognition algorithm offers.</p>
